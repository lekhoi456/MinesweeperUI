# MinesweeperUI
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
In this project, we will cover this interesting game by applying Material Design to make the game look more beautiful and attractive, and machine learning to make the game smarter.
